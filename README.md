# Computer-Solves-Mastermind

How classic Mastermind works: one player chooses a combination of 4 non-repeating colors out of a set of colors. The second player job is to guess that exact combination of colors, in the same order aswell. Each turn the guessing player make his guess, Then the codemaker rates his guess with 2 diffrent kind of pegs: white means 1 color of the guess is in the series, and black means 1 color is in the series and in the correct location. Now, the guessing player needs to make an educated guess based on which pegs the codemaker placed.

In this project I built Mastermind between you and the computer, where you are the codemaker and the computer needs to guess the series of colors you chose. First, enter how many colors are in this series (up to 10, more on that later) and how many guesses you allow the computer to guess.

Then, starts the guessing algorithm:
